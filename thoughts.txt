A Workout consists of Exercises

An Exercise consists of a 
- name
- notes
  - rep range
  - working weight
  - technique
- Sets

A Set consists of a
- set number
- weight done
- reps completed
- type ("WORKING", "WARMUP", "DROPSET", "FAILED")
- status ("COMPLETED", "IN PROGRESS")

Initialize newly picked exercise with one set with empty
weight and reps.
Set number starts with one and increments every time 
'Add Set' is pressed.
Type and status are initialized with values 'WORKING'
and 'IN PROGRESS' until the user possibly changes them.

Instead of having multiple components for headerTimer 
I should just render one from app and then manage what 
is shown from that one component and create more 
under that component as needed.


When to insert/modify data in database:
- When user starts a new blank workout or routine
- When a user creates/deletes a routine
- When a user adds/deletes an exerciseInstance
- When a user creates/deletes an exercise
- When a user changes the status of a set
- When the user ends/cancels a workout
- When a user looks at their workout history
- When a user looks at the history of an exercise

Need to add screens for these first
