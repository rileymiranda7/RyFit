A Workout consists of Exercises

An Exercise consists of a 
- name
- notes
  - rep range
  - working weight
  - technique
- Sets

A Set consists of a
- set number
- weight done
- reps completed
- type ("WORKING", "WARMUP", "DROPSET", "FAILED")
- status ("COMPLETED", "IN PROGRESS")

Initialize newly picked exercise with one set with empty
weight and reps.
Set number starts with one and increments every time 
'Add Set' is pressed.
Type and status are initialized with values 'WORKING'
and 'IN PROGRESS' until the user possibly changes them.

Instead of having multiple components for headerTimer 
I should just render one from app and then manage what 
is shown from that one component and create more 
under that component as needed.
